Example code to train a graph neural network to do node level predictions
using the PyG extension of PyTorch

`sim_dummy_data.r` simulates random networks with one target value

`gnn_test.py` trains on the simulated data. Takes an arbitrary number
of networks of arbitrary sizes and trains using edge weights only.
